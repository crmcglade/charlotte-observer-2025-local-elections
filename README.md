# Elections 2025 Results

This repo cleans and crunches 2025 local election results in North Carolina, and specifically focuses on counties surrounding Charlotte. One code notebook creates result totals per contest and candidate, which is then used in populate charts on the Charlotte Observer website. The other code notebook is specifically for the transit tax, and creates a file that can be mapped by precinct to see how the vote margin differs by area.

Both code pushes files to a Google Drive folder, which auto-populates the datavizes.
